  <div id="sherrythomas" class="about">
    <p>I am a psychodynamic, relational, somatic, and experiential therapist. I treat a range of problems: mood disorders, psychosis, anxiety, and other forms of distress; I specialize in the treatment of trauma. My work with clients is integrative, humanistic, client-centered, and rooted in neuroscience. I help clients uncover, understand, and metabolize their deeper motivations and emotions. As they become aware of their subconscious, they discover clarity and choice, and their lives begin to change.
      <br><br>I support clients with emotional regulation, interpersonal communication, and learning mindfulness. My work aims to nourish, support, and ground clients through connection, compassion, and awareness.
      <br><br>I am a master's-level Licensed Mental Health Counselor in Washington. My LMHC license number is LH61141780. I am also a certified Substance Use Disorder Professional, SUDP #: CP60616352.</p>

    <h1> History </h1>
    <p>Like yours, my life is complex and always changing. I have worked in cafes, advertising agencies, early childhood education, outpatient clinics, and public schools. I have experienced betrayal, violence, and loss of beloveds. I know how it is to fail. I know what addiction feels like. I am familiar with feeling alone in a crowd, scared in my own home; not having enough to get by.
      <br><br>I have also experienced deep love, connection, loyalty, joy, safety, success, and empowerment. I know recovery well and understand there are many ways to get there. In my free time, I enjoy my family, music, and exercise. I also like gardening, reading, writing, creating art, meditating, and studying. I love drinking tea, especially matcha!</p>

      I am an active member of the Northwest Alliance for Psychoanalytic Study. I have been engaging in mindfulness practice for over 20 years. Deepening my understanding of psychology is a never-ending journey. This year I am embarking on a yearlong training/study of Integral Somatic Psychology (ISP). ISP is based on the latest neuroscientific understanding of embodied cognition, emotion, and behavior from the West, and the most comprehensive understanding of the multiple bodies that contribute to our experiences from the East.
