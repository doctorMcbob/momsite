  <div id="sherrythomas" class="about">
    <p>I am a psychodynamic, relational, and experiential therapist. I treat a range of problems: mood
      disorders, psychosis, and other forms of distress; I specialize in treatment of trauma. My work with clients is integrative, humanistic and client centered. I help clients uncover, understand, and metabolize their deeper motivations and emotions. As they become aware of their subconscious, they discover clarity and choice, and their lives begin to change.<br><br>
      I support clients with emotional regulation, interpersonal communication, and learning mindfulness. My work aims to nourish, support and ground through connection, compassion, and awareness.<br><br>
      I am a master's level Licensed Mental Health Counselor in the state of Washington, LMHC #: LH61141780. I am also a certified Substance User Disorder Professional, SUDP #: CP60616352.

  <div id="history" class="about">
    <h1> History </h1>
    <p>Like yours, my life is complex and always changing. I have worked in cafes, advertising, early childhood education, out-patient clinics, and public schools. I have experienced betrayal, violence, & loss of beloveds. I know how it is to fail. I know what addiction feels like. I am familiar with feeling alone in a crowd, scared in my own home; not having enough to get by.<br><br> I have also experienced deep love, connection, loyalty, joy, safety, success, and empowerment. I know recovery well and understand there are many ways to get there. When I am not working, I like to spend my time engaging with music, exercise, cooking, reading, family, writing, creating art, in meditation and study. I love drinking tea and an occasional coffee.</p>
