  <h1>Sexuality and Gender</h1>
  <p>
    As an ally of all gender identities and in support of all consensual sex, it is with great honor that I work with clients wanting to explore, discover, express, accept and celebrate their gender and sexuality. I am sex-positive, body-positive, kink friendly and supportive of the asexual experience. In short, when it is consensual, I support you in your experience.<br><br>
    In addition to providing a safe & sacred space, I am here to witness and document your readiness for medical assistance with any gender confirmation services you might need.<br><br>
    I am here too, to support you in your quest to accept the gender identity and sexuality of others in your life.
